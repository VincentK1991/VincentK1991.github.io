I am a data scientist at Integral Ad Science. My current work focuses on developing machine learning solutions to understand social media content at scale for the purposes of brand safety and contextual targeting. That is to say, we are using machine learning and artificial intelligence to make sure that online ads are seen in safe and suitable environment, and accurately reach target audiences.


I completed my PhD in molecular biophysics at the Rockefeller University. My PhD research utilizes machine learning approaches to do 3D reconstrucion of protein structures from cryo-electron microscopic images, as well as biochemical experiments to answer the how the structures we have explain the biological mechanistic working of the proteins. In particular I am interested in proteins that work as molecular machinery controlling import/export of molecules in or out of the cells.

### More Information

Before that, I completed my undegrad in biology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2015.

In my free time, I enjoy developing practical data solutions to real-world problems using data science tools like NLP, generative AI, computer vision, and interactive web visualizations. Please check out the [Blog](https://vincentk1991.github.io/)  to read about it.
