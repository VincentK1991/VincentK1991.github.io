I am a graduate fellow working towards a PhD degree in biophysics at the Rockefeller University. My research utilizes machine learning approaches to do 3D reconstrucion of protein structures from cryo-electron microscopic images, as well as biochemical experiments to answer the how the structures we have explain the biological mechanistic working of the proteins. In particular I am interested in proteins that work as molecular machinery controlling import/export of molecules in or out of the cells.

### More Information

I completed my undegrad in biology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2015. 

In my free time, explored various topics in machine learning and data analysis. These include [tutorials](https://vincentk1991.github.io/tutorial/) on neural network and Bayesian statistics written as blogs, [COVID-19 summarizer](https://vincentk1991.github.io/GPT2-summarizer/) from GPT-2, and a [program](https://vincentk1991.github.io/Hello-World/) analyzing the complicated electoral system change in Thailand General election 2019, what what it might mean for Thai politics.
