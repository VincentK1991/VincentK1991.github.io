I am a graduate fellow working towards a PhD degree in biophysics at the Rockefeller University. My research utilizes machine learning approaches to do 3D reconstrucion of protein structures from cryo-electron microscopic images, as well as biochemical experiments to answer the how the structures we have explain the biological mechanistic working of the proteins. In particular I am interested in proteins that work as molecular machinery controlling import/export of molecules in or out of the cells.

### More Information

I completed my undegrad in biology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2015. 

In my free time, I work on various topics in deep learning, mostly NLP or connection between NLP and computer vision. For example, I wrote a deep learning algorithm based on OpenAI-GPT2 and BERT to perform domain-specific summarization. I also work on sketch2code as well as content-based image retrieval.

I am also interested in probabilistic programming, particularly for Bayesian inference. I wrote a tutorial on probabilitic programming, and Bayesian regression implemented in Pymc3.
