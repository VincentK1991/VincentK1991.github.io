This page groups a set of work that I created as a learning materials, mainly to teach myself, other  interested readers, and as a repository for me to look up at leter time. Setting apart from the project, the tutorials are meant to be pedagogical, rather than to showcase the work. The subjects that I am most interested in include **machine learning**, **deep learning**, **Bayesian inference**.

## Tutorials on Bayesian Regression using Pymc3

I gives my take on probabilistic programming as a specialized way of coding to implement statistical calculation. I briefly introduce Pymc3 a popular package in Python for probabilistic programming. I then use Pymc3 to explore various Bayesian regression techniques including *multiple regression*, *controlling for a variable*, *causal inference*, *hierarchical modeling*, *class interaction*, and a light touch on *generalized linear model*.
